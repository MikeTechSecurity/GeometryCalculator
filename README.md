# GeometryCalculator
Geometry Calculator in Python

Write a program that displays the following menu:
-------------------------------------------------
  Geometry Calculator
1. Calculate the Area of a Circle
2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
3. Calculate the Area of a Triangle
4. Quit
Enter your choice (1—4).
-------------------------------------------------

If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display its area. Use the following formula to calculate the circle's area:

    area = πr²

Use 3.14159 for and the radius of the circle for r.
If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and width of the rectangle, and then display the
rectangle's area. Use the following formula to calculate the rectangle's area:

    area = length x width

If the user enters 3, the program should ask for the length of the triangle's base and its height, and then display its area. Use the following formula to calculate the area of the triangle:

    area = base x height x .5

If the user enters 4, the program should end.

Use a module to display the menu.  Use modules to calculate and display the areas of each shape.  The program should validate the input.  The program should continue until the user chooses the quit option on the menu.
